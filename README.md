## Overview

This project is a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application designed with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for trading on BitMEX and Binance, with plans to expand to additional exchanges in the future. The interface simplifies the trading process by allowing users to place orders and manage trades efficiently, offering real-time data visualization, and intuitive controls.

## Features

- **Multi-Exchange Support**: Currently supports BitMEX and Binance, with the capability to expand to more exchanges.
- **Order Management**: Place orders with detailed information about the actual order cost, fees, quantity, and order value calculated in one place.
- **Candlestick Charts**: Custom-built candlestick charts that allow users to select entry prices directly by clicking on the chart.
- **Leverage Selection**: Easily select any range of leverage offered by the exchange.
- **Real-Time Price Data**: 
  - Market value fetched via a WebSocket connection to Binance API.
  - Stable live price value offered by BitMEX.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed for efficiency and ease of use, allowing traders to focus on strategy rather than navigating a complex interface.
